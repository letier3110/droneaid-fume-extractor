This Design fits a 92mm Fan. You can scale it if you need other sizes. You can print it with PLA/PETG/ABS etc.
- Mostly no supports are needed, except for the PCB-Holder (Add manual support only for the 4 holes) and the LED-Holder (printing it vertical would make it wobble a lot).
- I would recommend printing the 92mm_pin_OnlyHorizontalPrint-revThread with 3 Wall loops or higher infill percentage.
- I would recommend printing the LED Holder with TPU or other soft material to make it unbreakable.
